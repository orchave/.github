# Orchave

## Comprehensive Data Archive

Orchave is a decentralized data oracle platform that empowers users to customize data APIs and become data providers. By eliminating centralized incentives, users can not only manage and provide their data but also become decentralized verifiers, contributing to the integrity and reliability of the network.

## Background
Blockchains are great at providing immutable storage and deterministic verifiable computations. However, they cannot access trusted real-world information available outside their networks. (Band protocol) -- bunun gibi bir ÅŸey yaz

In current solutions, traditional systems rely on centralized incentives. Orchave has a different approach.

### Reflektive
With Orchave, users can seamlessly supply data to the blockchain through demand-driven APIs, creating new monetization opportunities.

### Decentralized
By allowing users to customize data APIs and become providers, Orchave fosters a collaborative ecosystem where data is decentralized. Each time the provided data is utilized, its value increases, attracting more verifiers to the network. This growing network of decentralized verifiers ensures the reliability and accuracy of the data, setting a new standard for data availability in blockchain applications.

### Social Trust
Orchave enables both verifiers and data providers to establish robust social trust systems. By supplying high-quality data, providers not only contribute to the network's integrity but also gain recognition and trust that extends beyond individual blockchains, fostering a more interconnected and reliable environment.

### ENS
Not only the verifiers but also the providers can create a social-trust system. Data providers provide **cross-chain reputation** with the data they provide.

Orchave enables both verifiers and data providers to establish robust social trust systems. By supplying high-quality data, providers not only contribute to the network's integrity but also gain recognition and trust that extends beyond individual blockchains, fostering a more interconnected and reliable environment.

### Avail
Verifiers can operate a light node with the support of Avail, ensuring continuous activity and maintaining system liveness. By providing data to the blockchain, users can also index the submitted data using Avail's fast block order finality. This capability facilitates the creation of a decentralized database, significantly enhancing the accessibility and organization of blockchain data.

### Filecoin
Currently, using Filecoin lacks sufficient incentivization for providers to maintain data, making it costly. Orchave addresses this issue by creating incentives for providers to store data on Filecoin. As the provided data is used, the gain for providers increases, motivating them to keep their data available.

Additionally, Orchave enhances Historical Data Availability by establishing a decentralized database on Filecoin. This ensures that data is not only preserved but also readily accessible, promoting a reliable and efficient storage solution.
